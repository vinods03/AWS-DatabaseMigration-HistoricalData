Create a Glue crawler on the S3 landing area - s3://vinod-ecommerce-data-from-rds/dev/orders/
Provide the Glue Catalog database name where the Glue Catalog table needs to be created.
Attach an IAM role to the Glue Crawler that has access to the required S3 bucket as well as the GlueServiceRole.

Once the Glue Crawler has completed successfully and Glue catalog table is created, query the table in Athena and perform some basic validations like count check.
