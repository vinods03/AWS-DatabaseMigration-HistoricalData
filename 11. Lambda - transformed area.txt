This will start Glue crawler on transformed layer, make audit entries in DynamoDB table and start glue job that will load transformed data into Redshift.
Ensure the role associated with this lambda has required access to DynamoDB and Glue.

Refer Code\Lambda\orders-transformed-data-lambda-function.txt for the code.

Note the usage of batch writing into dynamodb.
Batch writing helps to:
a) Achieve higher throughput and lower latencies by writing, deleting, or replacing multiple items in a single request
b) Take advantage of parallelism without having to manage multiple threads on your own

Also, note the usage of pagination when using the s3 boto3 client.
Without the usage of pagination, only 1000 records will be processed when using list_objects_v2.
